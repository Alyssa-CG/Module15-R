MPG Regression

    The MPG Multiple Linear Regression Model is as follows:

    mpg = 6.267'vehicle length' + 0.001'vehicle weight' + 0.069'spoiler angle' 
            + 3.546'ground clearance' - 3.411AWD - 103.964

        Residual standard error: 8.774 on 44 degrees of freedom
        Multiple R-squared:  0.7149,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825 
        F-statistic: 22.07 on 5 and 44 DF,  p-value: 0.0000000000535

    From the data we can see that: 

        * The probability of the vehicle length, ground clearance and the intercept contributing 
            a random amount of variance is extremely low. That is, vehicle length, ground clearance
            and other variables not included (as seen from the intercept) provide a non-random
            amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

        * The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The p-value is 0.0000000000535,
            far smaller than an assumed 0.05, which means there would be sufficient evidence to reject
            the null hypothesis.

        * The linear model does predict the mpg fairly effectively, with a multiple r-squared value 
            of 0.715 and an adjusted r-squared value of 0.683. Either value shows the majority of mpg
            prototype predictions will be correct when using this model.


Suspension Coil Summary

    Summary Statistics Table for the suspenstion coil's pounds-per-inch continuous variable:
            Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
            1463    1497    1500    1500    1501    1536 

            Variance = 76.235
            Standard Deviation = 8.731
    
    The variance of the coils must not and does not exceed 100 pounds per inch. 
    This is clear from the data wherein:
        * Mean and Median are the same indicated normal distribution (no skew).
        * The variance is only 76.235 with a standard deviation of 8.731, which combined are still within 
            the design specifications.


Suspension Coil T-Test

    One-sample t-Test
        data:  SuspensionCoil$PSI
        t = -0.65784, df = 149, p-value = 0.5117
        alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
        95 percent confidence interval:
        1498.122 1500.940
        sample estimates:
        mean of x 
        1499.531 
    
    Our p-value is well over the assumed 0.05 threshold so we do not have sufficient evidence to reject 
    our null hypothesis, that is, the data shows the sample mean and the population mean are statistically
    similar.


Design Own Study

    Metrics:

        There are many factors consumers must consider when buying a car. I would narrow down to three and
        choose to consider any connections between:
            1) Price
            2) Drive Type
            3) Shape 
        for my study. I believe these are important variables, easily affected by each consusers income (price),
        family size (a larger family may prefer a vehicle shape with more seating), road conditons 
        (extremely snowy may affect interest in four wheel/all wheel Drive Types), lifestyle and preferences. 

    Hypotheses:

        1)  H0 = Mean price of the MechaCar is similar to the mean price of other vehicles in its class.
            Ha = Mean price of the MechaCar is not similar to the mean price of other vehicles in its class.

        2)  H0 = Vehicle choice is not affected by Drive Type
            Ha = Vehicle choice is affected by Drive Type

        3)  H0 = Vehicle shape does not affect sales
            Ha = Vehicle shape does affect sales

    Statistical tests

        Different tests may be used at times but for my study I would opt to use the following:

            1) One sample t-test to determine if mean price is statistically different or not from the population.
            2) Chi-square to determine if there is a difference in categorical frequencies.
            3) Chi-square to determine if there is a difference in categorical frequencies.

    Data:
        1) We would need data on car prices across the industry, especially for cars in the MechaCar's class 
            to determine a population mean.
        2) We would need categorical data across the industry on sales of cars by Drive Type to get frequencies.
        3) We would need categorical data across the industry on sales of cars by Shape to get frequencies.

    When designing a study there are numerous factors that could be looked at besides these three here.
